<h3>Operational Security Oversight Dashboard</h3>
<p>
    With the help of Project Lead Michael Machado, Craig partook in a highly
    important project to create a software for Cisco that would allow daily
    vulnerability scans in Cisco's Collaboration Cloud firewall and routers.

<h3>Microsoft Cloud Migration</h3>
<p>
    Mary Sue required the help of someone reliable for some tedious but very important 
    data migration to the cloud. The company found that a part of the office in San Francisco
    had dated computers that were still not a part of the new system, but the work was deemed
    too vital to leave.
